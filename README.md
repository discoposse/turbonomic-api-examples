----

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  * [System Requirements](#system-requirements)
  * [API Versions](#api-versions)

## Getting Started

### Scratch Folder

We have included a scratch folder which is excluded from Git version control.  Please use this folder to save your test files and scratch files so that they are not uploaded into the Git repo during commits.

### System Requirements

You will need to have cURL for most of these examples.  Samples also require you to have the credentials for your Turbonomic instance, and the IP address or DNS hostname to access the API.

### API Versions

Examples will use the traditional API and the new API.  Samples will indicate which API are being used.
